In Java Classes are basic building blocks.
When defining class we are describing all characteristics of the class
Class has two main elements: i) Fields/ Variables  ii) Functions/ Methods
Variables hol state of our application
Methods are operations that we can call

For each instance variable, a getter method returns its value while a setter method sets or updates its value.
Given this, getters and setters are also known as accessors and mutators, respectively.

The getter method returns the value of the attribute.
The setter method takes a parameter and assigns it to the attribute.

Getters and setters allow control over the values. You may validate the given value in the setter before actually setting the value.

Why use getters and setters?
Getters and setters allow you to control how important variables are accessed and updated in your code.
