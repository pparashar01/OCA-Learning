A package in Java is used to group related classes.
Think of it as a folder in a file directory.
We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code.
Packages are divided into two categories: i) Build-in   ii) User-Defined

--Build-in Packages--
    --> The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment.

--User Defined Packages--
    --> To create your own package, you need to understand that Java uses a file system directory to store them.
